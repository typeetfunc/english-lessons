#### Andrei tells about his programming hobbies and interests
About my hobbies, topics of interest to me, and my non-working activities:

1) Client-server synchronization and distributed systems. I've translated "Distributed systems for fun and profit" to [Russian](https://github.com/typeetfunc/distsysbook/tree/russian-translate). I like to read new articles about consensus problems and try new distributed databases. Also, I'm interested in DevOps methodology and tools, for configuring and managing distributed systems and/or microservices. For example, see [my experiments with Ansible](https://github.com/typeetfunc/ansible-experiments)

2) State/data management and stateful-application patterns(especially in frontend). I believe in the need to use functional programming patterns, such as lenses, isos, and other optics, to manage complex and immutable states. I have written [article about my experience with lense](http://blog.csssr.ru/2016/07/08/lenses/). Also, I think that experiments with client-side database and logic query languages, such as GraphQL and Datalog, are very important. I have coded several projects for DataScript(it is embedded client-side analog of Datomic) - [datascript-mori](https://github.com/typeetfunc/datascript-mori), [rx-datascript](https://github.com/typeetfunc/rx-datascript), [babel-plugin-datascript](https://github.com/typeetfunc/babel-plugin-datascript)

3) IO abstraction patterns and side-effects management approaches. I think that side-effects management is a key part of good architecture. All modern approaches for architecture design contain IO/side-effects abstraction layer(for example port/adapters in hexagonal arch, UI layer in DDD, Boundary in EBI, Interface/Frameworks&Drivers in Clean Arch). I've researched several reactive and functional approaches for side-effects management(such as stream IO, monadic IO, algebraic effects). This research resulted in I've written [article](https://blog.csssr.com/ru/article/side-effects/) and made [lecture](https://youtu.be/SHehkxWDYDE) and [presentation](http://typeetfunc.github.io/drafts/effects/effects.html#1)

4) Syntaх/semantic code analysis and transformation. Usually, I consider using code analysis tools in two common cases. First of all, I need to use these tools for assessing, measuring code quality, finding bad practices, and making massive refactoring of large projects. I've written several codemodes - for example, [my rewritten fork of tool for converting PropTypes to Flow annotation](https://github.com/typeetfunc/codemod-proptypes-to-flow). The second case of using the AST transformation tool is extending JS language abilities. For example, I've made [babel plugin for precompiling datalog query in JS](https://github.com/typeetfunc/babel-plugin-datascript) Also, I've participated in the development of [babel-plugin-ramda](https://github.com/typeetfunc/babel-plugin-ramda)

5) Program verification and validation. I believe in the need to look beyond auto-testing and static types. I've researched property-based testing, mutation testing, theorem provers, and language with dependent/refinement types. I've had a course about "Programming with dependent types in Idris". Also, I've made a lecture for an internal conference about [approaches of proving the correctness and controlling different properties of software](https://youtu.be/yckjMWTuLSg) ([presentation]http://typeetfunc.github.io/drafts/property/property.html#1). It was a very common overview lecture, but after this, I started the research of property-based testing, because I think that this is the most practical topic. I've written [article about practical cases for property-testing](http://blog.csssr.ru/2017/04/25/property-testing/) and had some experience with [jsverify library](https://github.com/iamstarkov/compose-function/blob/feat/property-based-testing-js-verify/test/prop.test.js). In my experience, the use of property-testing requires a good connection with contract system for convenient creation of data generators. Today this idea is implemented in Clojure.Spec. And even before that, I made libraries that help to use jsverify with [tcomb](https://github.com/typeetfunc/tcomb-generate) and [runtypes](https://github.com/typeetfunc/runtypes-generate)  

6) Psychology of education and andragogy. I devote a lot of time to interviewing candidates, mentoring, and developing a personal development plan for my colleagues, and I research theory that can help me in this field. I've read many books about education and psychology and known about many psychological schools. Today my favorite schools are 'cultural-historical activity theory' and 'Gestalt theory'. I've used the concepts such as Zone of Proximal Development and Force-field analysis for development interview and mentoring methodology. I've talked a little about this on [my lecture about interviewing in Kiyv Polytechnic Institute](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnQZ1zZbKwdxhPM1YPq2n3DI10D2JA?e=Iku8Zb). Also, I've participated in [public interview on Hexlet](https://youtu.be/Awnog8KYub4) and made [series of videos about interviewing](https://youtu.be/KLsJOtGDWZY).

Also, I have some other topics for non-working time research [on my github](https://github.com/typeetfunc/anxiete).
 
My English level is B1(Intermediate). I can read English fluently and can write and talk on working topics.
