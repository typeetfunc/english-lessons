# Modal Verbs

## Description
These verbs are helpers and differ from any general verb and has following usage rules:
-  don't use an 's' for the third person singular;
-  make question by inversion (without do/did, there is a helper verb already): She can sign. -> Can she sign?
-  are followed directly by the infinitive of another verb (without 'to').

There are several cases when we use modal verbs.
