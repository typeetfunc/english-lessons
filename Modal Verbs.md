# Modal Verbs

## Description
These verbs are helpers and differ from any general verb and has following usage rules:
-  don't use an 's' for the third person singular;
-  make question by inversion (without do/did, there is a helper verb already): She can sign. -> Can she sign?
-  are followed directly by the infinitive of another verb (without 'to').

There are several cases when we use modal verbs.
### Probability (Вероятность)
We can use these modal verbs (also called modals of deduction, speculation or certainty) when we want to make a guess about something. We choose the verb depending on how sure we are.

- #### Talking about present:
__must / might / could / may / can't + infinitive__

> _She must be on the bus. (I'm fairly sure this is a good guess)  
She might come soon. (maybe)  
She could be lost. (maybe)  
She may be in the wrong room. (maybe)  
She can't be at home. (I'm fairly sure this isn't true)_

__will / won't__

We use will and won't when we are very sure:

> _She'll be at work now._

__should / shouldn't__

Should and shouldn't are used to make an assumption about what is probably true, if everything is as we expect:
> _They should be there by now.  
It shouldn't take long to drive here._

__can__

Can is used for something that is generally possible, something we know sometimes happens:
> _Prices can be high in London._

Can is not used to talk about specific possibilities:
> _He could be on the bus._ (not: 'can be')

- #### Talking about past:
__must / might (might not) / could (could not) / may (may not) / can't + have + past participle (3rd form)__

> _She must have forgotten about our date.  
She might have worked late.  
She could have taken the wrong bus.  
She may have felt ill.  
She can't have stayed at home._

__will / won't + have + past participle__

Will and won't / will not + have + past participle are used for past certainty (compare with present use of 'will' above):
> _The parcel will have arrived before now._

__should + have + past participle__

Should + have + past participle can be used to make an assumption about something that has probably happened, if everything is as we expect (compare with present use of 'should' above):
> _The train should have left by now._

__could__

We can use could + infinitive to talk about a general possibility in the past (compare with the use of 'can' above):

> _Prices could be high in the sixteenth century._

This is not used to talk about specific possibilites in the past (instead we use could + have + past participle):

> _He could have been working late._ (not: 'could be'. As this is a specific possiblity, 'could be' is present tense)


### Ability (Возможности, навыки)
When we talk about ability, we mean two things.

First, we mean __general ability__. This is something that once you have learned you can do any time you want, like being able to read or swim or speak a language, for example.

The other kind of ability is __specific ability__. This mean something that you can or can't do in one particular situation. For example, being able to lift something heavy, or find somewhere you are looking for.

- #### Talking about present:

__can / can't (for both general and specific ability)__
> _I can play the piano.  
She can speak English.  
He can't drive – he's too tired.  
We can't come now._

- #### Talking about past:

__could / couldn't__ (for general ability)

> _I could read when I was four.  
She could speak French when she was a child, but now she has forgotten it.  
He couldn't dance at all until he took lessons.  
My grandfather couldn't swim._

__was able to / couldn't__ (for specific ability)

> _When the computer crashed yesterday, I was able to fix it.(not 'I could fix it')  
She was able to pass the exam, even though she hadn't studied much.(not 'she could pass')  
He called us because he couldn't find the house.  
I couldn't open the window._

### Permission (Разрешения)

We can use verbs such as __can__, __could__ and __may__ to ask for and give permission. We also use modal verbs to say something is not allowed.

> _Could I leave early today, please?  
You may not use the car tonight.  
Can we swim in the lake?_

### Obligation (Должествование)

- #### Should (Ought to) - __следует__
_Mild obligation, use to express advice, suggestion, opinion_.

> _You really sould stop smoking, it's bad for you._  
> _You shouldn't smoke anymore._

__Past form: should/shouldn't have + 3rd.__
_A past action which didn't happen: the advice / regret is too late_

> _You should have gone to bed earlier, now you have missed the train._

- #### Must - __должен__
Strong obligation (from your personal decision or law/order/etc.) - внутренняя необходимость/подчинение:
> _I must finish this course in a week._  
> _We must not eat this food. It's expired_  
> _You mustn't smoke here._

Friendly advice (emotional):
> _You (simply) must watch this, it's awesome._

__Past form: no past form, use had to instead.__

- #### Have to (= Have got to) - __придется__, __быть вынужденым__
Strong obligation (from outside) - внешняя необходимость: **придется**, **должен**, **вынужден**
> _The deadline is tomorrow, I have to finish the project today._  
> _I have to go to the bank to unblock my card._

don't have to - __отсутствие необходимости__

> _I don't have to get up early next morning._

__Past form: had to/ didn't have to.__
> _I had to wear a school uniform when I was a child._


## Future tense
There is no such way of casting any of the modal verbs _can/could, may/might, must, shall/should, will/would_ in future form with _will_.

This is because the modal verbs are all _defective_: they have only two forms, past and present (_must_ has only one), so they lack the infinitive form which follows auxiliary will.

There are two ways around this.

1.  The simple present of most verbs can be used with future reference, so one thing you can do is simply use _can_ with some indication of futurity.
    
    > I cannot do that tomorrow.  
    > I may do that tomorrow.
    
2.  The other thing you can do is employ the infinitive of a "periphrastic" construction as the complement of _will_. With _can_, for instance, the periphrastic construction is _BE able to_; with _will_ it's _BE going to_.
    
    > I will not **be able to** do that.  
    > I will **be going to** do that.
    
    Other periphrastics which come in handy for this are:
    
    > for _may/might_: _be permitted/allowed to_: He will be permitted to do that.  
    > for _must_: _be obliged/required to_: He will be obliged to do that.  
    > for _should_: _be expected to_: He will be expected to do that.  
    > for _will_: _be going to_: He will be going to do that.
    
    There are more, because all the modals have a wide variety of meanings, and many of these meanings have one or more periphrastics.
    

Note that the modal verbs have no participles either, so they can't be cast in the perfect construction or employed as gerunds or adjectives. Again, the way around this is to employ the appropriate periphrastic:

> I have been able to do that.  
> Being able to do that would be helpful.

Modal verbs are intransitive and can't be cast in the passive, and they're stative and therefore can't be cast in the progressive, so you don't have to worry about those forms.
