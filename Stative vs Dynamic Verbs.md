Some English verbs, which we call state, non-continuous or stative verbs, aren't used in continuous tenses (like the [present continuous](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/present-continuous.html), or the [future continuous](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/future-continuous.html)). These verbs often describe states that last for some time. Here is a list of some common ones:

A verb which isn't stative is called a dynamic verb, and is usually an action.

**Some verbs can be both stative and dynamic:**

**Be**

be is usually a stative verb, but when it is used in the continuous it means 'behaving' or 'acting'

-   you are stupid = it's part of your personality
-   you are being stupid = only now, not usually

**Think**

-   think (stative) = have an opinion  
    I think that coffee is great
-   think (dynamic) = consider, have in my head  
    what are you thinking about? I'm thinking about my next holiday

**Have**

-   have (stative) = own  
    I have a car
-   have (dynamic) = part of an expression  
    I'm having a party / a picnic / a bath / a good time / a break

**See**

-   see (stative) = see with your eyes / understand  
    I see what you mean  
    I see her now, she's just coming along the road
-   see (dynamic) = meet / have a relationship with  
    I've been seeing my boyfriend for three years  
    I'm seeing Robert tomorrow

**Taste**

-   taste (stative) = has a certain taste  
    This soup tastes great  
    The coffee tastes really bitter
-   taste (dynamic) = the action of tasting  
    The chef is tasting the soup  
      
    ('taste' is the same as other similar verbs such as 'smell')
