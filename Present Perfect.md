-   I haven't seen her this month.

### Present perfect vs past simple
 -  When did you start working for this company? (потому что начал в законченном периоде в прошлом - речь именно о старте а не о работе - если бы был перфект вопрос то был бы вопрос с since/for и глаголом work)
 -  Glad to see you again! Where have you been?(где ты был до того как мы встретились)
