### Finished actions, states or habits in the past.
**with a finished time word (yesterday, last week, at 2 o'clock, in 2003) - in contrast with [[Present Perfect]]** 

-   I went to the cinema yesterday.
-   We spent a lot of time in Japan in 2007.
-   We travelled a lot when I was a child.

**General truths about the past**
when we know from general knowledge that the time period has finished. This includes when the person we are talking about is dead.

-   Leonardo painted the Mona Lisa.
-   The Vikings invaded Britain.

**that we have introduced with the [[Present Perfect]] or another tense. This is sometimes called 'details of news'.**

-   I've hurt my leg. I fell off a ladder when I was painting my bedroom.
-   I've been on holiday. I went to Spain and Portugal.

**Main events in a story**
we often use the past simple for the actions in the story and the [[Past Continuous]] for the background.

-   He *went* to a caf√©. People *were chatting* and music *was playing*. He sat down and ordered a coffee.

### Unreal or imaginary things in the present or future.
We use the past simple to talk about things that are not real in the present or future. So we use it with the **second conditional** and after words like 'wish'.

-   If I won the lottery, I would buy a house.
-   I wish I had more time!
