### _will_ [[Future Simple]]

We use _will_ to talk about spontaneous plans decided at the moment of speaking.

> _Oops, I forgot to phone Mum! I'll do it after dinner._   
> _I can't decide what to wear tonight. I know! I'll wear my green shirt._  
> _There's no milk. I'll buy some when I go to the shops._

### _going to_

We use _going to_ to talk about plans decided before the moment of speaking.

> _I'm going to phone Mum after dinner. I told her I'd call at 8 o'clock._  
> _I'm going to wear my black dress tonight._   
> _I'm going to go to the supermarket after work. What do we need?_ 

### [[Present Continius]]

We usually use the present continuous when the plan is an arrangement – already confirmed with at least one other person and we know the time and place.

> _I'm meeting Jane at 8 o'clock on Saturday._   
> _We're having a party next Saturday. Would you like to come?_
> > _I**'m visiting** my friend tomorrow.  
> We **aren't going** to school today.  
> What **are** you **doing** tonight?_

We often use the present continuous to ask about people's future plans.

> _Are you doing anything interesting this weekend?_
